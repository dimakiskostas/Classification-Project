<h1>Description</h1>
<p>In this project we perform a multi-class classification task where we implement machine learning classification algorithms.</p>
<p>The algorithms that are included are:</p>
<p>1) Principal Component Analysis<br>2) Least squares<br>3) K Nearest Neighbors<br>4) N Naive Bayes<br> 5)Multilayer Perceptron<br> 6)K-Means</p>
<p>There are diagrams that show different results. Also Latex is used in order to give some information about each algorithm.</p>


<h2>Data set</h2>
<p>The data sat that was used for this project is an extended version of the well known iris-dataset. It contains new feautes like Petal area, Sepal area, Leaf area, Petal curvature etc.</p>



<h2>Project contents</h2>
<p>1) Introduction<br>2) Imports<br> 3) Data processing<br> 4) Data visualazation <br> 5) Algorithm implementation</p>
